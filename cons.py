"""Problem
A matrix is a rectangular table of values divided into rows and columns. An m×n
 matrix has m
 rows and n
 columns. Given a matrix A
, we write Ai,j
 to indicate the value found at the intersection of row i
 and column j
.

Say that we have a collection of DNA strings, all having the same length n
. Their profile matrix is a 4×n
 matrix P
 in which P1,j
 represents the number of times that 'A' occurs in the j
th position of one of the strings, P2,j
 represents the number of times that C occurs in the j
th position, and so on (see below).

A consensus string c
 is a string of length n
 formed from our collection by taking the most common symbol at each position; the j
th symbol of c
 therefore corresponds to the symbol having the maximum value in the j
-th column of the profile matrix. Of course, there may be more than one most common symbol, leading to multiple possible consensus strings."""
